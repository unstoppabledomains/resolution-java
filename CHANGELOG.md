## 6.1.0
### Changes
 * Updated default providers to use [Alchemy](http://alchemy.com/)

## 6.0.0

### New methods and features 
 * Reverse resolution support via `Resolution#getReverse` and `Resolution#getReverseTokenId` methods
 * Updated `.zil` domains resolution to support domains that were migrated to UNS

### Breaking changes
 * `Resolution#getNamehash` now requires a `serviceType` parameter to specify which type of namehash to generate (ZNS or UNS)
 * `Resolution#getLocations` and `Resolution#getBatchOwners` now support `.zil` domains. Note that ZNS does not have optimized functions for batch operations so performance for `.zil` domains may be slow.

## 5.0.0

### Breaking changes
* Ens support has been removed from the library.
* Library builder methods regarding ens has been removed: `ensChainId`, `ensProviderUrl` and `ensContractAddress`
## 4.1.0
### Changes
 * Library builder methods no longer require UNS smart contract addresses for known networks (mainnet, testnet). Only `unsChainId` and `unsProviderUrl` methods are required.

## 4.0.0
### Breaking changes
* Library builder methods has changed it's signature. Almost all methods now has prefixes related to specific name server (`UNS`, `ZNS`, `ENS`)
  * Example of changed methods:
    * `ensChainId`
    * `unsChainId`
    * `znsChainId`
* ENS considered deprecated and will be removed in future

### New methods and features 
* 🎉 🎉 🎉 Add Polygon Layer 2 support!
* Introduced `Resolution#getBatchOwners` method to resolve owner addresses of many domains only for UNS.
* Introduced `Resolution#getRecords` method to resole multiple records of a single domain.
* Introduced `Resolution#getAllRecords` method to resole all known records of a single domain.
* Introduced `Resolution#getLocations` method to resole all known records of a single domain.
* Add `Resolution#getLocations` method which will help to determine domains location (blockhain, networkId) and useful metadata like owner, resolver, registry addresses, provider url if possible.
  * Method returns:
    * Domain blockhain (ETH or MATIC)
    * Blockchain network id (numeric)
    * Owner address
    * Resolver address
    * Registry address
    * Provider URL if possible
      * Infura URL by default
* Domain name is now trimmed and lowercased before resolving
* Domain names that are not accomply with this regex `^[.a-z\d-]+$` will throw a NSExceptionCode.InvalidDomain

## 3.0.0

### Breaking changes
* `Resolution#isSupported` is now making an async call and throws `NamingServiceException` 
* `NamingServiceType.CNS` was replaced by `NamingServiceType.UNS`. 
* Removed deprecated constructor, to build the instance use Resolution.builder() instead
* Remove deprecated Resolution#getUsdt, use Resolution#getMultiChainAddress() instead
* Remove deprecated Resolution#addr, use Resolution#getAddress() instead
* Remove deprecated Resolution#namehash, use Resolution#getNamehash() instead
* Remove deprecated Resolution#email, use Resolution#getEmail() instead
* Remove deprecated Resolution#ipfsHash, use Resolution#getIpfsHash() instead
* Remove deprecated Resolution#owner, use Resolution#getOwner() instead
* Remove deprecated TickerVersion enum

### New methods and features
* 🎉 🎉 🎉 Added support for new TLD's ( .888, .nft, .coin, .blockchain, .wallet, .x, .bitcoin, .dao )
* Introduced `DomainResolution#getTokenURI` - Retrieves the tokenURI from the registry smart contract.
* Introduced `DomainResolution#getTokenURIMetadata` - Retrieves the data from the endpoint provided by tokenURI from the registry smart contract.
* Introduced `DomainResolution#unhash` - Retrieves the domain name from token metadata that is provided by tokenURI from the registry smart contract.
* Return ENS support
* Allow setting custom contract addresses in `Resolution.Builder` to support local testnet environment
